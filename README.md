# Shadow Siren Mod

_**aka Vivian The Spire**_


This mod currently adds Vivian from the game Paper Mario - The Thousand-Year Door.

Alongside her is a full suite of 75 cards that are not guaranteed to play well with other mods. I did my best. While I do not yet know of any incompatibilities, please let me know if you find any.

All assets are from Paper Mario - TTYD and are property of Nintendo and their respective owners. 

This mod is a work in progress, but it is still a fully playable (if not balanced) experience at the moment.

_**Damage Types & Block Types:**_ 
Vivian makes use of Icons Addon to add 4 new damage and block types to the game, each bundled into their own card type.

_Fire_ - Fire cards overall have strong base values and center around Vigor and Card Draw. Fire Damage deals 25% more damage to enemies with 75% or more HP, and also reduced a targets Max HP by damage dealt. Fire Block scales with Vigor as well as normal block scaling.

_Ice_ - Ice cards overall have strong defensive nature and revolve around damage mitigation. Ice Damage applies Chill on hit, a stacking power that makes the target deal 5% less damage per stack. At 10 stacks, Chill is removed, and the target is Frozen, stunning them and making them take 25% more damage for the rest of combat. Ice Block deals damage to attackers equal to their Chill.

_Electric_ - Electric cards overall have strong offensive nature and scaling capabilities. Many Electric cards gain Charge, a power that increases the damage and block of the next card played for the rest of combat. Electric Damage causes an arc on hit, dealing an additional 50% damage to a random target. Electric Block applies Shock to attackers, making them take additional damage the next time they are hit.

_Shadow_ - Shadow cards overall have weaker damage and block, but excel in support and 0 cost builds. It does have access to some scaling via Shadow Split though, should you run a shadow only deck. Shadow Damage ignores Block and causes the enemy to lose HP equal to its Shadow Split (similar to Pressure Points with Mark). Shadow Damage applies Shadow Split to the attacker.
