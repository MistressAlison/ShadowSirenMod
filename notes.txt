//TODO Reworks needed

=== Relics ===

Boo Sheet / Super Sheet - See mechanics rework

Mystery Box - Needs new effect that wont bug out

Ice Pop / Fire Pop / Electro Pop - Give elemental effects? What about Shadow?

Power Punch - First interface removed, needs new effect

Hot Sauce - Burn removed, perhaps Rare Fire relic?

Repel Cape - broken

Ruin Powder - Soft removed, perhaps rework to Common/Uncommon Shadow relic?

Spite Powder - Perhaps rework to Rare Shadow relic? Probably not, but should be reworked either way

Point Swap - just stupid rn

Common Elemental Relics - Fire Pop, Ice Pop, Electro Pop, ?

Uncommon Elemental Relics - Fire Flower, Ice Storm, Volt Shroom, ?

Rare Elemental Relics - ?, Stop Watch, Tasty Tonic, ?



=== Cards ===

Star Fall - Currently too similar to Elemental Burst?

Esc Plan -

Tri Attack -

Polychrome -

White Out - Currently far too strong. Repeated elemental combo

Ashes - Retain, exhaust when dealing Fire damage?


=== Mechanics ===

Veil / Hyper - Currently implemented as stances via relics only. Bad cohesion.


=== Fixes ===

Overheat - Cards drawn before power is ready, so drawn Curses/Status might not exhaust
