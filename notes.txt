//TODO Reworks needed

=== Relics ===

Boo Sheet / Super Sheet - See mechanics rework

Mystery Box - Needs new effect that wont bug out

Ice Pop / Fire Pop / Electro Pop - Give elemental effects? What about Shadow?

Power Punch - First interface removed, needs new effect

Hot Sauce - Burn removed, perhaps Rare Fire relic?

Repel Cape - broken

Ruin Powder - Soft removed, perhaps rework to Common/Uncommon Shadow relic?

Spite Powder - Perhaps rework to Rare Shadow relic? Probably not, but should be reworked either way

Point Swap - just stupid rn

Common Elemental Relics - Fire Pop, Ice Pop, Electro Pop, ?

Uncommon Elemental Relics - Fire Flower, Ice Storm, Volt Shroom, ?

Rare Elemental Relics - ?, Stop Watch, Tasty Tonic, ?



=== Cards ===

Star Fall - Currently too similar to Elemental Burst?

Ashes - Potentially rework -> Retain, exhaust when dealing Fire damage? Seems problematic

Recuperate / Trick - Give one a similar but different effect

Frostbite - rework so less text? lol

Immolate - new name?

Shadow Sneak - rework?

New Rares:

Preparation - Retain your hand this turn. Next turn gain Energy

Ricochet - The next card you play is returned to your hand.


=== Description Shrinking ===

Patch Up - 5 lines

Frostbite - 5 lines

Permafrost - 5 lines

Black Hole - 5 lines

Blast Burn - 5 lines

Elemental Mastery - 5 lines

Star Fall - 5 lines





=== Mechanics ===

Veil / Hyper - Currently implemented as stances via relics only. Bad cohesion.

Fire Damage - Now even worse with the rework



=== Fixes ===

Overheat - Cards drawn before power is ready, so drawn Curses/Status might not exhaust / Draw 2(3) cards. Exhaust any Status or Curse cards drawn this way?



=== Multi Element Stuff ===

FI - Frostfire
FS - Spirit Burn
EI - Mag Strike
ES - Shade Shock

IS - White Out
FE - Plasma Beam

Shadow 2 reworks:

Shadow ignores Block and applies 1 Split on hit. Split makes the target take 5% more shadow damage to a maximum of 5 stacks (+25% more damage).
Absorb (Keyword) - Remove Shadow Split from the target and gain Shadow Block/Temp HP/Whatever

Black Roses - ?
Creeping Shadows - The first card you play each turn is put on the bottom of your draw pile. It costs 0 until played?
Sinister Reflection - ?
? - If Fatal condition?


Electric rework theory: Deals +?% more damage per target, but spreads damage to all targets.
