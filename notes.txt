//TODO Reworks needed

=== Relics ===

Boo Sheet / Super Sheet - See mechanics rework

Mystery Box - Needs new effect that wont bug out

Ice Pop / Fire Pop / Electro Pop - Give elemental effects? What about Shadow?

Power Punch - First interface removed, needs new effect

Hot Sauce - Burn removed, perhaps Rare Fire relic?

Repel Cape - broken

Ruin Powder - Soft removed, perhaps rework to Common/Uncommon Shadow relic?

Spite Powder - Perhaps rework to Rare Shadow relic? Probably not, but should be reworked either way

Point Swap - just stupid rn

Common Elemental Relics - Fire Pop, Ice Pop, Electro Pop, ?

Uncommon Elemental Relics - Fire Flower, Ice Storm, Volt Shroom, ?

Rare Elemental Relics - ?, Stop Watch, Tasty Tonic, ?



=== Cards ===

Star Fall - Currently too similar to Elemental Burst?

Ashes - Potentially rework -> Retain, exhaust when dealing Fire damage? Seems problematic

Recuperate / Trick - Give one a similar but different effect

Flash Fire - new conditional

Immolate - new name?

Black Roses - nerf?

New Rares:

Preparation - Retain your hand this turn. Next turn gain Energy

Ricochet - The next card you play is returned to your hand.




=== Mechanics ===

Veil / Hyper - Currently implemented as stances via relics only. Bad cohesion.

Fire Damage - Now even worse with the rework



=== Fixes ===

Overheat - Cards drawn before power is ready, so drawn Curses/Status might not exhaust / Draw 2(3) cards. Exhaust any Status or Curse cards drawn this way?



=== Multi Element Stuff ===

FI - Frostfire
FS - Spirit Burn
EI - Mag Strike
ES - Shade Shock

IS - White Out
FE - Plasma Beam
